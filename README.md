# MTPKit

A dependency-free Swift package for talking to Android devices from macOS — browse storage and move files both ways over **USB (MTP)** and **Wi-Fi (ADB)**, behind one `async` `DeviceTransport` abstraction.

Extracted from [Android File Transfer](https://github.com/5j54d93/Android-File-Transfer), a Finder-like macOS app.

## Features

- **MTP over USB**, spoken directly through `IOUSBHost` — no `libmtp`, no C dependencies.
- **ADB over Wi-Fi** transport, with QR / pairing-code / IP pairing and mDNS auto-discovery.
- A single `DeviceTransport` protocol for both backends, plus a `MockTransport` for tests and previews.
- `async`/`await` throughout, `Sendable` value types, and a real-time `DeviceChange` event stream.
- Streaming up/download with progress reporting; handles files larger than 4 GB.
- Zero third-party dependencies. Error messages localized in English and 繁體中文.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+
- Swift 6+ (Xcode 16+)

## Installation

Swift Package Manager:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/5j54d93/MTPKit.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

Then add `"MTPKit"` to your target's dependencies.

## Usage

```swift
import MTPKit

// USB / MTP
guard let transport = await MTPTransport.discover() else { return }
let storages = try await transport.storages()
let root = try await transport.listChildren(of: nil, in: storages[0].id)

try await transport.download(node.id, to: localURL) { progress in
    print(progress.fractionCompleted)
}
```

Both USB and Wi-Fi backends conform to `DeviceTransport`, so they're interchangeable from the caller's side.

## Notes for consumers

- **`adb` binary (Wi-Fi only):** MTPKit does **not** bundle `adb`. `ADBClient` looks for it first in your app bundle (`Bundle.main`), then in common install locations (Homebrew, Android SDK), or you can pass an explicit path with `ADBClient(adbPath:)`. The USB/MTP path needs nothing extra.
- **Entitlements:** USB access via `IOUSBHost` requires the *consuming app* to declare the appropriate USB device entitlement, and the ADB transport spawns the `adb` subprocess — configure your app's sandbox/entitlements accordingly. A library can't carry these for you.
- **Tests:** the hardware ("live") tests no-op gracefully when no device is attached, so the suite stays green on CI / without a phone.
